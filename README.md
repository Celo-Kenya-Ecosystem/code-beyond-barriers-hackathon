#### Project Description

Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?
Everyday the human rights and protection areas faces numerous challenges such as tampering with victims evidence by the culprits, some victims fear fr their safety thus do not report cases of violation of their rights out of fear of being hunted down or victimized, loss of evidence due to incompetent and at times improper technoloy data managment systems to permanently store and difficulty to easily access data and evidence due to outdated file systems. The Ushahidi Blockchain Data Management System aims to solve the above challenges by ffering scalable solutions in the Celo Blockchain.

The proposed project would involve creating a digital evidence management system that utilizes blockchain technology to store and secure digital evidence, such as video and audio recordings, photographs, and other types of data. This system would be built on top of the Ushahidi platform, and would work to enhance the platform's existing capabilities for collecting and managing information, particularly in the context of human rights protection.
The use of blockchain technology in this project would provide several key benefits for the Ushahidi platform. Firstly, it would ensure the integrity and immutability of the digital evidence stored on the system, making it tamper-proof and preventing any unauthorized changes or modifications. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology would make it much more difficult for bad actors to compromise the system and access or destroy the digital evidence stored on it.
Moreover, the blockchain-based digital evidence management system would provide an added layer of security and privacy for the individuals who provide the evidence. The system would enable users to submit digital evidence anonymously and securely, and it would also provide a way to trace the evidence back to the original source, which would ensure accountability and transparency.

Gaps Addressed by the Platform
The digital evidence management system would help the Ushahidi platform by addressing several key gaps in its current capabilities. These gaps include:
Data Integrity: The use of blockchain technology would ensure that the digital evidence stored on the system is tamper-proof, preventing any unauthorized changes or
modifications, and thus increasing the trustworthiness of the data.
Security: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology would make it much more difficult for bad actors to compromise the system and access or destroy the digital evidence stored on it.
Privacy: The blockchain-based digital evidence management system would provide an added layer of security and privacy for the individuals who provide the evidence. The system would enable users to submit digital evidence anonymously and securely.
Traceability: The system would also provide a way to trace the evidence back to the original source, which would ensure accountability and transparency.
Scalability: The Ushahidi platform is currently limited in terms of the number of reports it canhandle, the blockchain-based digital evidence management system would help to increase the scalability of the platform.
Accessibility: With the use of blockchain technology, the Ushahidi platform would be moreaccessible to a wider range of users, including those who are less technically savvy, as the technology is designed to be easy to use and accessible.



#### Summary

Our proposed project would create a digital evidence management system that uses blockchain technology to store and secure digital evidence, such as video and audio
recordings, photographs, and other types of data, which would enhance the Ushahidi platform's existing capabilities for collecting and managing information, particularly in the context of human rights protection.
The digital evidence management system would help Ushahidi to improve the integrity, security, privacy, traceability, scalability and accessibility of the platform and the
information it collects which is vital in the context of human rights protection
