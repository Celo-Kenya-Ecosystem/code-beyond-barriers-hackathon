#### Project Description
Citizen journalism refers to the act of members of the general public playing an active role in the process of collection, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. Citizen journalism plays a significant role in governance as it promotes accountability, transparency, and civic engagement. It supports democracy and amplifies the voices of marginalized communities. However, credibility and quality control pose a major challenge. Currently, validation and verification of information gained from citizen reporting is time-consuming and is faced with limited resources.

This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized citizen reporting platform that employs community-driven curation to streamline the validation and verification process and ensure the accuracy and credibility of the disseminated information. 

The platform will allow users to submit news and information for review by the community and vote on the credibility and relevance of information submitted by other users based on their specific regions. Items with a high number of votes for each region are then escalated to regional validators selected by the community, who verify the credibility and relevance of the information and further escalate the matter.
